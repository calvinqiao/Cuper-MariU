# Cuper-MariU

A video game project 'Cuper-MariU', implemented in C++.

1. We have included a make file in the "Cuper MariU" folder.
Please compile every time before running the game.

2. A "User Guide" is provided.
Compile instructions and game instructions are given in the file.

3. Our code is product independent, so the game can be compiled and run on
any machine. However, we are using yssimplesound for our music and sound effects.
This would mean that music and sound effects are only available to those who are
using Mac platform.

4. "Update_log" documented our work for putting all the files together, 
	along with our debugging history.

5. Please enjoy our game!
